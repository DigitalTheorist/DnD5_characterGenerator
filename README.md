# DnD5_characterGenerator
Java stack DnD character generator.

building as a fun learning project for Java.*

current version: will generate two wizards with the same names and spell damages. 

Todo add: 
  - User inputted name.
  - How many characters would you like to create?
  - Of what class? 
  - Build weapons shops and randomized weapons assignments based on a number of gold pieces inputted. 
  - Basic fight generator between two characters. Based on user input (IE "would you like the generated characters to             fight?").


*full disclosure - using DnD 3rd edition because I actually have the books! Awesome.
